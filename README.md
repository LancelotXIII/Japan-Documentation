## Narita Airport to Tokyo

Narita International Airport is 60 km (37 mi) from central Tokyo.

**Taxi** is the most expensive option. A taxi from Narita to the Shibuya or Shinjuku area will cost anywhere from ￥20,000 to ￥25,000 depending on traffic. A taxi to the Tokyo Station area will run anywhere from ￥19,000 to ￥22,000 depending on traffic. Several "flat rate" private hire car services are also available, but the rates for these services are comparable to taxi rates. Without the traffic, the drive time from Narita Airport into metro Tokyo is about 75-100 minutes. During rush hour, this can easily jump to 2 hours or more.

There are two express trains serving Narita: the **Keisei Skyliner** and the **Narita Express**. Both offer ample storage for luggage and are designed for airport travelers with plenty of space.

The **[Keisei Skyliner](https://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/skyliner/index.php)** travels between Narita and Keisei-Ueno Station in about 40 minutes. It is the cheaper of the two express trains, but not by much. The Skyliner is the best option for travelers staying in Akihabara, Ueno, and other locations near east or northeast metro Tokyo. For travelers whose final destination is not near Ueno Station, taking the Keisei Skyliner requires a transfer at either Nippori or Ueno stations, which can be cumbersome for travelers with a lot of luggage or small children and increases the cost of the trip. (Example: A traveler staying in Shinjuku can take the Skyliner to Ueno, and then pay anywhere from ¥200-340 to get from Ueno to Shinjuku, depending on trains used.) [Slightly discounted tickets](https://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/e-ticket/en/eticket/index.html) can be purchased online prior to departure, otherwise full fare tickets are ¥2570 for adults or ¥1290 for children, and they can be purchased at the airport upon arrival. Using an IC Card (PASMO, Suica etc.) discounts the Skyliner fare by ¥5. The last Skyliner departs Narita airport at 23:00 on both weekdays and weekends/holidays. The last Skyliner from Tokyo departs Keisei-Ueno at 20:20 on both weekdays and weekends/holidays.

The **[Narita Express (N'EX)](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/nex/)** is a high-speed train that shuttles passengers between Narita Airport and several major stations in the greater Tokyo area including Tokyo, Shinagawa, Shibuya, Shinjuku and Yokohama. The N'EX arrives at Tokyo station in about 60 minutes, Shibuya in 80 minutes, and Shinjuku in 90 minutes. Travelers going to Tokyo Station who do not want to transfer from the Skyliner at Ueno and do not mind the negligible cost difference should utilize the N'EX. Travelers staying in Shibuya, Shinjuku and other areas in western metro Tokyo should utilize the N'EX over the Skyliner as you can reach your destination without transferring. [Ticket fare](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/nex/tickets/) depends on the passenger's final stop along the N'EX station line. Fares to Tokyo Station are ￥3070; Shinjuku/Shibuya/Shinagawa/Ikebukuro are ￥3250; Yokohama is ￥4370. Child fares are approximately 50% of adult fares and are valid for children ages 6-11; children under 6 are free. A [highly discounted round-trip N'EX ticket](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/pass/nex.html) is available for foreign passport holders and can be purchased upon arrival at Narita Airport at the JR ticket counters. These round-trip passes are ￥4070 for adults and ￥2030 for children, regardless of the destination and departure station. JR Pass holders can ride the N'EX to and from Narita with a valid (activated) pass. The last N'EX departs Narita airport at 21:44 daily. The last N'EX from Shinjuku leaves at 19:39 and from Tokyo station at 20:03.

Please make sure that if you are continuing beyond Shinagawa station, to either Shibuya/Shinjuku/Hachioji or Yokohama/Ofuna, you enter the correct cars as the train is split at Shinagawa station.

A slower but more affordable option for travelers staying in East Tokyo is the **[Keisei Access Express](https://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/nrt_access/index.php)**. A one-way ticket for adults costs ￥1310 and ￥660 for children ages 6-11. There is no round-trip discount ticket. If Asakusa, Skytree, or one of the other stops listed is not your final destination, you will need to transfer stations, which will require moving luggage, paying additional train fare, and increases in travel time.

The cheapest (and slowest) train option is the **[Keisei Limited Express](https://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/traffic/main.php)**, which takes riders from Narita to Ueno Station in 80 minutes. (For reference, this is the same amount of time it takes for the N'EX to reach Shinjuku on the other side of the city.) A one-way ticket for adults costs ￥1050 and ￥530 for children ages 6-11. There is no round-trip discount ticket. If Ueno is not your final destination, you will need to transfer at Ueno, which will require moving luggage, paying additional train fare, and increases travel time significantly.

Because the trains in Japan stop running after a certain time, the **[Airport Limousine Bus](https://www.limousinebus.co.jp/en/)** is a popular option for travelers with late flight arrival times. Most Limousine Buses arrive at their destinations between 80-100 minutes, although traffic and travel to locations outside the 23 Wards can bump this time to 2 hours or more. Fares and timetables vary by route and time, so please check the route list for more information. (For reference, a traveler going to Shinjuku can expect to pay ￥3200 yen for adults and ￥1600 for children with a total travel time of about 100 minutes.)

Another bus option is the **[Keisei Expressway Bus](https://honyaku.j-server.com/LUCKEISEIB/ns/tl.cgi/https://www.keiseibus.co.jp/kousoku/nrt22.html)**, operating several routes in Kanto area, including service to Tokyo (TCAT), Yokohama (YCAT), and Ikebukuro stations.

**Please note that if you take a flight before 8am on domestic routes and 9:30am on international flights, you should consider staying the night in Narita city.**

## Trains and Subways
#### How can I find train/subway routes, bus routes, or timetables?

There are many apps and websites to help decipher and plan public transportation routes throughout Japan. For English speakers and tourists, the most reliable website is [Jorudan](https://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/?sub_lang=nosub), which contains options to use JR Pass compatible routes only, as well as an option to search timetables of each station.

It provides several routes based on desired departure or desired arrival times and will include information such as: Fare, seat fee (a cost that is in addition to ticket fare mostly used on long-distance trains), travel time, transfers and platform information (for select number of stations), as well as contains data for certain highway bus and ferry connections.

Advanced features such as limiting results to the mode of transport require subscription. Alternatively one can use Google Maps transport layer features, although it is sometimes can create sub-optimal routes.

Navitime (and its English-language counterpart JapanTravel by Navitime) has a significant popularity among Japan’s residents and has more features, such as real-time delays — and requires monthly subscription.

Note that Google Maps is an only English-language resource for local buses and it may be not as accurate as Navitime or local sites.

Specific maps for local trains and shinkansen in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka can be found [here](https://www.jrailpass.com/maps) and this covers both JR and non-JR lines.

#### How much are local (non-Shinkansen) train, subway or bus fares?

Most local train systems work on a distance-based fare system, where the cost of your trip depends on how far you travel. A single ride will usually cost you anywhere from ￥140-￥550 — although most tourists tend to travel shorter distances, making the average train ride cost on the lower end of that range. If you are planning on heavily utilizing trains for sightseeing, or if your lodging is further from main tourist areas, you should plan on taking at least 3-4 train rides per day.

Some common train routes and average fares for reference:

-   Shinjuku to Akihabara (Tokyo) - ￥170  
    
-   Shinjuku to Harajuku (Tokyo) - ￥140  
    
-   Shibuya to Ueno (Tokyo) - ￥200  
    
-   Shibuya to Maihama (Tokyo Disney) - ￥420  
    
-   Tokyo Station to Yokohama (Tokyo) - ￥470  
    
-   Osaka Station to Tennoji (Osaka) - ￥190  
    
-   Kyoto Station to Osaka Station (non-Shinkansen) - ￥560  
    
-   Hiroshima Station to Miyajimaguchi (Hiroshima) - ￥410  
    

To get a more accurate sense of how much you might spend on train fare, use [Jorudan](https://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/?sub_lang=nosub) to plot out train routes you plan on taking.

Local bus lines either use flat-rate or distance-based fares, with the type of fare varying between bus operators and between cities. For example, many of the major bus services operating within the 23 Wards of Tokyo use a fixed-fare system. A good rule of thumb to determine whether a bus utilizes distance fares or flat fares is to note how passengers board the bus. Buses where passengers board at the front of the bus and scan their IC card or pay immediately are generally flat-rate buses. Buses where passengers board from the middle or rear of the bus and but tap their IC card upon embarking and disembarking (or take a ticket upon embarking and pay when disembarking) usually charge based on distance.

Average bus fares range from ￥100-250 for flat-rate buses and ￥190-350 for distance-based buses. Many communities also offer free local buses or shuttles.

#### How do I purchase (non-Shinkansen) train or subway tickets?

Most tickets for local train and subway systems are purchased via automated ticketing machines located in nearly every station outside of the ticket gates. [JR's official website](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/ticket/purchase.html) has a handy English guide and video that explains the ticket purchasing process utilizing JR ticketing machines.

Train fares are calculated by distance traveled. Travelers purchasing individual tickets and not using an IC card will have to use the fare map located above or near the ticketing machines at their starting station to determine the cost of train fare. This is done by locating the intended arrival station on the map and noting the fare associated with that stop. Transferring between rail lines requires buying individual tickets for each line utilized (ie: JR to Keio). It is important to note that most stations only offer this fare map in Japanese — so travelers without Japanese language skills may find the individual ticket purchasing process to be difficult.

Because of the difficulty in calculating individual ticket costs, especially when travel involves transferring between rail lines, most Japanese residents and tourists opt to use a rechargeable **IC card** when utilizing public transportation. The IC card automatically calculates the fare traveled and deducts that fare from the card's stored balance. Cards can be "topped up" at any ticket machine bearing the universal [IC card logo](http://puu.sh/oMNkv/1e90151375.jpg). Utilizing an IC card also offers a slight discount (~￥5) on train fare versus purchasing an individual ticket.

-   Do trains or city buses in Japan run 24 hours?

> No. The time train or bus service stops depends on a variety of factors — including location, transportation company policy, day of the week, whether or not the day is a holiday, etc. In major metropolitan areas, such as Osaka or Tokyo, train service is generally suspended between the hours of 12am to 5am, with a few variations. It is very important to familiarize yourself with your "last train" — the last train you can take to make it back to your lodging or intended destination before service stops. Depending on how far you must travel or where you are located, your last train could be as early as 10-11pm.

## Budgeting
#### **Trains**
Most local train systems work on a distance-based fare system, where the cost of your trip depends on how far you travel. A single ride will usually cost you anywhere from ￥140-￥550, although most tourists tend to travel shorter distances, making the average train ride cost on the lower end of that range. If you are planning on heavily utilizing trains for sightseeing, or if your lodging is further from main tourist areas, you should plan on taking at least 2-4 train rides per day.

Some common train routes and average fares for reference:

-   Shinjuku to Akihabara (Tokyo) - ￥170
-   Shinjuku to Harajuku (Tokyo) - ￥140
-   Shibuya to Ueno (Tokyo) - ￥200
-   Shibuya to Maihama (Tokyo Disney) - ￥420
-   Tokyo Station to Yokohama (Tokyo) - ￥470
-   Osaka Station to Tennoji (Osaka) - ￥190
-   Kyoto Station to Osaka Station (non-Shinkansen) - ￥560
-   Hiroshima Station to Miyajimaguchi (Hiroshima) - ￥410

To get a more accurate sense of how much you might spend on train fare, use [Jorudan](https://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/) to plot out train routes you plan on taking.
#### **Long-Distance Train Travel / Shinkansen**
To calculate how much your shinkansen ticket will cost, you can either use [Jorudan](https://world.jorudan.co.jp/mln/en/) or the [JR Ticketing website](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/ticket/reservation.html). A shinkansen ticket is made up of several fees:

-   **Base fare**: The fare to be paid to get from A to B. Increases step wise according to the distance traveled. Issued as a base fare ticket (乗車券).
    
-   **Shinkansen supplement (limited express fee)**: The supplement fee to be paid for using a shinkansen train (as opposed to a local train). The fee increases step wise according to the distance traveled. The express supplement is issued as a limited express fee ticket (特急券).
    
-   **Seat reservation fee**: ￥320/￥520/￥720 depending on whether it is low season, regular season or high season. An additional supplement (￥100-620 depending on distance traveled) applies for using reserved seats on Nozomi, Mizuho, Hayabusa and Komachi trains. The seat reservation fee is usually combined with the express supplement into a single ticket.
    
-   **Green car fee**: The supplement fee for riding the green car. Increases step wise according to the distance traveled. It is usually combined with the express supplement into a single ticket.
    

A passenger typically receives two pieces to their tickets (a base fare ticket and a supplement ticket), although in some situations the two tickets are combined into a single ticket. If multiple trains are involved, there can be more than two tickets (one supplement ticket for each train).

#### Lodging
-   ￥2000-3000/night (dirt cheap): For this price, you can stay in capsule hotels or youth hostels. A lodging like this will provide you a comfortable, basic, and safe place to sleep, without many amenities and with some downsides, like lack of space and needing to check out each day and find a place to store luggage.
-   ￥3000-6000/night (cheap): For this price, you can get a shared hostel, shared AirBnB, or possibly private AirBnB (in some more remote parts of major cities). At a lodging like this, you will most likely have a comfortable and safe place to stay, reasonable amenities, and fairly easy or easy access to public transit.
-   ￥6000-12000/night (moderate): For this price, you can get a private hostel room, private AirBnB, or no-frills business hotel room. At a lodging like this, you will most likely have a comfortable and safe place to stay in a central location, good amenities such as a 24-hour front desk and before-checkout/after-checkout luggage storage (at a hotel), and easy access to public transit.
-   ￥12000-18000/night (high): For this price, you can get a mid-tier "western style" hotel room, basic ryokan room, or private AirBnB rental. You will most likely have a plush and safe place to stay in a central location, great amenities such as good toiletries and a concierge (at a hotel), and easy access to public transit.
-   ￥18000+/night (luxury/splurge): For this price, you can get basically any good hotel room in any location you'd like. If you are looking for a luxury hotel in a central location or a fancy ryokan (such as one with in-room onsen bath), your prices will probably end up higher than ￥18000.

## SIM Cards / eSIM
For travelers with unlocked cell phones, a **physical SIM card** or **eSIM** is an easy option, as it allows you to utilize Japanese cell towers without incurring roaming charges, and it eliminates the need to carry a second device and charger. However, if your phone is on contract with a service provider in your home country (i.e., "locked") then you will be unable to use a SIM/eSIM in Japan. When renting or buying a physical SIM card, be sure to select the proper SIM card size that is compatible with your phone. Many retailers or service providers do not allow exchanges if the wrong size is purchased.

Physical SIM Cards can either be rented in advance or purchased upon arrival in Japan at the airport or at any major electronics retailer. Physical SIM cards are usually tiered by amount of data and length of validity (e.g., a 10GB card good for 14 days).

Many modern phones are also capable of eSIM technology, which is software on your phone that mimics SIM card technology and allows you to "install" virtual/non-physical SIM cards on your phone. With an eSIM, there's no need to pick up a physical SIM card. Your phone simply already has the capability to manage multiple eSIMs at once. eSIMs can be purchased online from a retailer or app, and they usually involve a small amount of set-up on your phone in order to work. Because there is no need to send or receive a physical device, the cost of an eSIM tends to be lower than a physical SIM card.
***
## Power
#### What kind of power adapter/converter do I need?

Japan uses 100V, 50/60Hz power and uses an ungrounded (2-pin) NEMA Type A 5-15 plug. Some North American consumer appliances will work fine in Japan without an adapter. However, certain equipment — especially consumer appliances involving heating (e.g. hair dryers, curling irons) — may not work properly or may even get damaged.

Almost all plugs in Japan are two-prong plugs. It's rare to find three-prong plugs in tourist areas such as hotels, etc.

Tourists from outside North America (ie: from countries where standard voltage is in the range of 220-240 V) **will need to use a power converter** while traveling in Japan. If you are from the US, Canada, Mexico or another country that uses a standard voltage 110 - 127 V, **you will not need a power converter**. These tourists, however, may want to purchase a [three prong to two prong converter](https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=two+prong+to+three+prong&rlz=1C1GGRV_enJP751JP751&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLnIq5mKHWAhXExbwKHXtsASsQ_AUICygC&biw=1493&bih=791&dpr=1.13) for any chargers or appliances that require a ground / have three prongs (ie: laptop chargers).
***
## Money
#### Where should I convert my home currency into Yen?

The easiest and best method to obtain Yen is to obtain it upon arrival in Japan, either by using an ATM or a currency exchange counter. Obtaining Yen in your home country is inadvisable as the fees and exchange rate will not be as friendly to travelers as they will in Japan itself.

All major International airports and other entry points have currency conversion counters or bank branches that can convert currency for you. As you will almost certainly need cash to pay for transportation from the airport to your lodging, it is best to obtain some cash at the airport if possible. The rates at Japanese airport kiosks are reasonable, though the best rates you'll get are from ATM withdrawals.

Please visit the following links for more information:

#### How much money should I carry with me?

You should always have at least ¥5000 in cash on your person. Many places still do not accept credit card.

Carrying large amounts of cash is not unheard of in Japan, and doing so is relatively safe, provided you do not misplace your wallet or bag containing your cash. You may want to bring a coin purse, as Japanese currency utilizes a fair number of coins.

#### Can I use Apple Pay/PayPay/mobile payments while in Japan?

Some retailers in Japan have begun accepting mobile payments. However, it is very possible your mobile payment company of choice may not be accepted by a particular establishment. The roll out for mobile payments in Japan begun some time in late 2018, so availability is limited. Chain stores and restaurants may accept Apple Pay et al, but smaller retailers and shops will generally only accept cash or credit card.
